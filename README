About plot.lisp
===============

This is a little program I wrote for fun, to become familiar with
SBCL's facilities for process management, and also for use in a personal
project. An example of the use of plot.lisp is included as example.lisp.

Please note that plot.lisp requires SBCL, Linux, and Gnuplot (which should be
installed in /usr/bin/gnuplot).
